toxgui
======

For-fun Tox client that tries to follow the Tox UI mockup while running on all major systems. <br/>
This GUI uses code from @nurupo's ProjectTox-Qt-GUI, in particular the "Core" Toxcore wrapper. <br/>
However, it is not a fork.

<h2>Features</h2>

- Friends chat
- Group chats (experimental, can only accept invitations)

<h2>Requirements</h2>

This client will run on Windows, Linux and Mac natively, but binairies will only be provided for Windows. <br/>
Linux and Mac users will have compile the source code themselves.
