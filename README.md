toxgui
======

This GUI uses code from @nurupo's ProjectTox-Qt-GUI, in particular the "Core" Toxcore wrapper. <br/>
However, it is not a fork.

<h2>Features</h2>

- Friends chat
- Group chats (experimental, can only accept invitations)
- File transfers, with previewing of images

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Linux and Mac users will have compile the source code themselves.
